# ðŸŽ€ Breast Cancer Classification Project
This project presents a comparative analysis of different deep learning models for classifying breast cancer MRI images into two categories: benign and malignant. The models evaluated in this analysis include **DenseNet**, **VGG16**, **InceptionV3**, and **MobileNetV2**. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis using a deep learning approach with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
